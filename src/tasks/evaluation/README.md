# Evaluation

## HMM scores
Calculated in this notebook (first half): [https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/sequence_stats.ipynb](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/sequence_stats.ipynb)


## First and Second Order sequence statistics
Calculated in this notebook (second half): [https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/sequence_stats.ipynb](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/sequence_stats.ipynb)


## Alignment to training data
There is a notebook "Align to training data" that contains all of the logic for the
corresponding section of the report. [https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/Align%20to%20training%data.ipynb](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/tasks/evaluation/Align%20to%20training%20data.ipynb)


## GB1 Evaluation
The notebook "GB1_fitness.ipynb" was used to generate the analysis of the ability to generate
GB1 scores. The notebook is configured to run using the ESM34 model by default. This model
can be changed in the notebook to explore other pre-trained models.
