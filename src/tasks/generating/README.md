[sampler_1](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/pgen/sampler_1.py) is a Gibbs sampler for ESM models.
[sampler_2_hf](https://github.gatech.edu/Deep-Learning-Project/common-workspace/blob/master/src/pgen/sampler_2_hf.py) is a Gibbs sampler for ProtBert and other models that use the Huggingface BERT interface.
[sampler_3](https://github.com/seanrjohnson/protein_gibbs_sampler/blob/main/src/pgen/sampler_3_hf.py) is a Gibbs sampler for ProtXLNet, but the sequeces it produces don't seem to be very high quality, so it is not recommended to use.
